# Implementation Document Usage Guide

## Summary
- **Goal:** Explain how to use an implementation document to execute work safely and consistently.

## Purpose
- **Use the implementation doc as the single execution checklist.**
- **Prevent scope creep** by following only the steps in the table.
- **Keep changes auditable** with status updates and remarks.

## Scope
- **Applies to:** Implementation docs in `Implementation/`.
- **Does not apply to:** Design docs, runbooks, or general notes.

## How to Use the Implementation Doc (Step-by-Step)
1) **Read the entire table once.**
   - Confirm all required steps exist and are ordered.
2) **Confirm inputs are available.**
   - Verify files, paths, or variables exist before starting.
3) **Execute one row at a time.**
   - Do not batch multiple rows unless they are explicitly dependent.
4) **Update `Implementation status` immediately after each step.**
   - Use `done` only after verification.
5) **Record any deviations in `Remarks`.**
   - Keep remarks short and factual.
6) **Re-check downstream inputs.**
   - If a step creates an output used later, verify the output is correct.

## Status Rules
- **Allowed values:** `todo`, `pending`, `done`, `blocked`.
- **When to set `done`:** Only after outputs are verified.
- **Never skip a status update:** Every executed step must be updated.
- **Ask for confirmation:** Always ask the user before changing any `Implementation status`.

## AI Touchbase Rules
- **locked:** Never change the step text or order.
- **flexible:** Minor edits allowed for clarity.
- **must:** The step must exist in the table.
- **If unsure, do not edit**; ask for clarification.

## Remarks Guidance
- **Use only when necessary.**
- **Capture deviations:** different path, version, or manual workaround.
- **Avoid design restatement:** do not re-explain the design in remarks.

## Checklist Completion and Validation
- **Pre-check:** All inputs exist and match expected paths.
- **Per-step validation:** Verify each output immediately after execution.
- **Post-check:** Confirm all required outputs exist and services are healthy.
- **Audit:** Ensure `ops/package-audit.md` or equivalent logs are updated if required by steps.

## Confidence Level
Add a confidence note **only in `Remarks`** when:
- A step required a manual decision or unclear input.
- Verification was partial or indirect.

**Confidence labels:**
- `high`: Verified output directly.
- `medium`: Verified indirectly (log evidence or partial check).
- `low`: Could not verify fully; needs follow-up.

## Guardrails (Avoid Project Drift)
- **Do not invent new steps.** If a step is missing, request a design update.
- **Do not modify unrelated files.** Stick to the step scope.
- **Do not change designs** while implementing unless explicitly instructed.
- **Do not merge steps** unless the table says they are combined.
