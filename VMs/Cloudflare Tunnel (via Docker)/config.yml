# Cloudflared tunnel config (template, no secrets).
# All app blocks are active by default.
# When you run install.sh, it can generate a filtered config based on tag blocks:
# - Tags are defined between: "# [tag]" and "# [/tag]".
# - install.sh asks which tags to enable, then writes config.generated.yml.
# - If you skip tag selection, this full config is used as-is.
