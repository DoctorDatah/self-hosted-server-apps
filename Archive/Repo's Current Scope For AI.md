# 📌 Working Scope & Context README

## Purpose of This README

This README exists to **define the current working context of this repository at any given moment**.

Because this repository contains **many different types of artifacts and multiple apps**, this file acts as a **scope limiter and attention guide**—especially for AI-assisted work. It clarifies:

- What parts of the repository are **in scope right now**
- What parts should be **ignored or treated as read-only**
- What kind of changes are **expected or allowed**
- What the **current focus and intent** of work is

This file should be updated whenever the focus of work shifts.

---

## What This Repository Contains (High-Level)

This repository is **multi-purpose and multi-layered**, including but not limited to:

### 📚 Documentation
- General documentation
- Walkthroughs and how-to guides
- Design documents
- Implementation guides
- Journal-style AI documentation and notes

### 🧠 AI / Process Guides
- Instructions for AI usage
- Prompting guides
- Reasoning or decision logs

### 🧩 Application Code
- Multiple applications
- App-specific scripts
- App-specific configurations

### ⚙️ Automation & Tooling
- Scripts
- GitHub Actions
- CI/CD-related files

Because of this breadth, **not everything is relevant at all times**.

## How to Use This README

This README should be treated as a **dynamic control document**.

Before starting work (human or AI), this file should answer:
- *What am I working on right now?*
- *What should I focus on?*
- *What should I ignore?*

If this README conflicts with other documentation,  
👉 **this README wins for the current working session**.

## Current Working Scope

> ✏️ **Update this section whenever your focus changes**

### In Scope
Describe what is actively being worked on right now. Be explicit.

---> Everything (since I am just establishing this repo)
---> Mainly, n8n app

Examples:
- Working on **a single application**
- Updating **documentation and walkthroughs only**
- Modifying **AI instruction files**
- Refactoring **scripts or GitHub Actions**
- Editing **repo-level instructions or manuals**

---

### Out of Scope
Clearly define what should **not** be modified or considered.

---> Walkthroughs folder (unless I explicitly ask something from there.)

Examples:
- Other applications in the repository
- Legacy or archived code
- Experimental or draft folders
- Deployment pipelines
- Any file not explicitly listed as in scope

---

## Allowed Types of Changes

Specify what kind of changes are expected during the current scope.

Examples:
- ✅ Documentation edits
- ✅ Instruction refinement
- ✅ Non-breaking refactors
- ❌ New features
- ❌ Breaking changes
- ❌ Architectural rewrites

---

## Intent of Current Work

Briefly explain **why** the current work is happening.

Examples:
- Clarifying instructions
- Improving AI collaboration
- Cleaning up outdated documentation
- Preparing for onboarding
- Laying groundwork for future changes

This helps align decisions and tradeoffs.

---

## Guidance for AI Assistance

When AI is used while working in this repository:

- Prioritize **current scope over repository-wide context**
- Do **not** assume all apps or folders are relevant
- Ask for clarification **only if scope is ambiguous**
- Prefer minimal, targeted changes aligned with stated intent

If something is unclear:
- Default to **not changing it**
- Flag it instead of modifying it

---

## Updating This README

This README is expected to change frequently.

Whenever you:
- Switch applications
- Change focus areas
- Move from docs → code (or vice versa)
- Narrow or expand scope

👉 **Update the “Current Working Scope” section first.**
