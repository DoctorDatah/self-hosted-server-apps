# Reading Guide for AI

## Summary
- **Goal:** Make AI reading deterministic, safe, and reviewable.

## Front Matter
- **Title:** Reading Guide for AI
- **Project:** Repo-wide documentation
- **Owner:** Malik
- **Status:** Draft
- **Last updated:** 2026-01-25
- **Related docs:** `AI/2b. design document formatting guide.md`, `AI/2a. design document writing guide.md`

## Purpose
- **Remove ambiguity** when interpreting docs.
- **Lock in exclusions** so they are never reintroduced.
- **Control rewrites** so meaning and scope do not drift.
- **Enable selective edits** by defining what can and cannot be changed.
- **Prevent over-editing** by constraining AI to update only approved sections when asked to edit docs.

## Reading Protocol
- **Start with Front Matter** to establish scope and authority.
- **Collect exclusions first**; treat them as hard constraints.
- **Extract variables and decisions** before reading details.
- **Separate facts vs decisions**; do not infer new decisions.
- **Stop on conflicts** and ask for resolution.

## Authority Order (highest wins)
- **Front Matter** overrides all other sections.
- **Exclusions** override requirements and examples.
- **Canonical statements** override non-canonical text.
- **Requirements** override descriptions and notes.
- **Examples** are lowest authority and never mandatory.

## Exclusions (how to interpret)
- **Definition:** Anything labeled excluded, deprecated, not used, or out of scope.
- **Commented-out variables** are excluded by default.
- **Examples are not requirements** unless explicitly labeled.
- **Soft language is not exclusion** unless it uses explicit markers.

## Exclusions (how to write)
- **Use a dedicated section:** `## Exclusions` with one-line bullets.
- **Inline marker:** prefix with `EXCLUDED:`.
- **Inline comment marker:** use `<!-- EXCLUDED: reason -->` when removing text.
- **Block marker:** use `<!-- EXCLUDED -->` and `<!-- /EXCLUDED -->` for multi-line exclusions.
- **Keep exclusions visible** for review.

## Custom Syntax (AI-readable markers)
- **Single-line syntax:** `KEYWORD: content` at the start of a line.
- **Multi-line syntax:** `<!-- KEYWORD -->` to start and `<!-- /KEYWORD -->` to end.
- **Markers (same naming for both forms):** use the table below.

| **Marker**          | **Meaning**                                           |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **CANONICAL**       | Authoritative statement for a topic                   |
| **EDIT-SCOPE**      | Allowed sections/files for edits in this request      |
| **MUST**            | Non-negotiable rule or behavior                       |
| **ALLOWED**         | Explicitly supported choices                          |
| **FORBIDDEN**       | Explicitly prohibited choices                         |
| **DEPRECATED**      | Should not be used                                    |
| **EXCLUDED**        | Out of scope or removed from use                      |
| **LOCKED**          | Must not be changed or moved                          |
| **IGNORE**          | Do not process or modify                              |
| **OPEN**            | Unresolved item requiring a decision                  |
| **OVERRIDE-AS-ADMIN** | Temporary, explicit permission to override a marker for this request |

## Conflict Rules (when markers disagree)
- **EXCLUDED beats ALLOWED** and MUST.
- **FORBIDDEN beats ALLOWED**.
- **DEPRECATED beats ALLOWED** and MUST.
- **CANONICAL beats non-canonical** statements.
- **LOCKED beats EDIT-SCOPE** and all rewrite intent unless `OVERRIDE-AS-ADMIN` is present.
- **If conflict remains, stop** and ask.

## Rewrite Rules
- **Preserve scope and intent**; do not add requirements.
- **Never reintroduce exclusions** or deprecated items.
- **Keep literal values** for paths, commands, variables, and names.
- **Maintain section order** unless asked to restructure.
- **Do not change locked text** marked with `LOCKED:` or inside lock blocks unless `OVERRIDE-AS-ADMIN` is present.
- **Edit only in scope** when `EDIT-SCOPE` is provided.
- **Default to no changes** outside `EDIT-SCOPE`.
- **Ask when missing context** before completing a rewrite.

## Fail-Safe Defaults
- **When unsure, do less**; remove instead of add.
- **Prefer explicit markers** over inferred meaning.
- **Do not assume support** for platforms or tools not listed.
- **Do not change values** inside inline code.

## Examples
```text
EDIT-SCOPE: `AI/1. reading guide for ai and syntax for developer.md`#Purpose, `AI/1. reading guide for ai and syntax for developer.md`#Examples

## Exclusions
- EXCLUDED: use of Ubuntu 20.04 for production nodes

## Requirements
- MUST: store secrets in GitHub Secrets
- FORBIDDEN: store secrets in plaintext files
- ALLOWED: Docker or Podman for local builds

<!-- IGNORE -->
This paragraph is historical context only.
<!-- /IGNORE -->

<!-- EXCLUDED -->
Legacy deployment steps are no longer supported.
<!-- /EXCLUDED -->

<!-- LOCKED -->
This section is legally binding and must remain unchanged.
The wording and order are fixed.
<!-- /LOCKED -->

OVERRIDE-AS-ADMIN: Approved by Malik on 2026-01-25 for this request only. Applies to `LOCKED` in this document.
```
**How AI should interpret the block above**
- **EDIT-SCOPE:** Only edit `Purpose` and `Examples` in `AI/1. reading guide for ai and syntax for developer.md`; do not touch other sections.
- **EXCLUDED:** Do not add or reintroduce Ubuntu 20.04 anywhere.
- **MUST/FORBIDDEN/ALLOWED:** Treat as strict rules; do not weaken or contradict them.
- **IGNORE block:** Leave the block unchanged and skip it for decisions.
- **EXCLUDED block:** Treat the entire block as out of scope and keep it removed.
- **LOCKED block:** Keep the exact wording and order; no edits inside unless `OVERRIDE-AS-ADMIN` is present.

```text
Decisions
- CANONICAL: The API base URL is `https://api.example.com/v1`
- DEPRECATED: The v0 endpoint is removed and must not be used
- OPEN: Decide whether to support Windows agents
- LOCKED: The primary region is `us-east-1`

<!-- LOCKED -->
This paragraph is contract text and must remain unchanged.
<!-- /LOCKED -->
```
**How AI should interpret the block above**
- **CANONICAL:** Treat as the source of truth; do not override with other text.
- **DEPRECATED:** Do not use or reference the v0 endpoint.
- **OPEN:** Do not decide; ask for a decision or list as unresolved.
- **LOCKED:** Do not modify that line or any locked block.

## Review Checklist
- **Exclusions captured** and enforced.
- **Variables and decisions** extracted explicitly.
- **No new requirements** introduced.
- **Conflicts flagged** and unresolved.
